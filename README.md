## aoi.js-mongo

- Easy to use package for the implementation of MongoDB in aoi.js with minimal changes.

### Setup

To get started with aoi.js-mongo, we have to do a couple things.

- Install the package.
```bash
npm install github:faf4a/aoi.mongo
```

- Update your index.js file.

```js
const { AoiClient, LoadCommands } = require("aoi.js");
const { Database } = require("aoi.mongo");

const client = new AoiClient({
  token: "DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
  prefix: "DISCORD BOT PREFIX",
  intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "GuildMembers", "MessageContent"],
  events: ["onInteractionCreate", "onMessage"],
  disableAoiDB: true // This is important, ensure it's set to true. You can't use both at once.
});

const database = new Database(client, {
    url: "mongodb+srv://...", // your mongoDB server uri
    tables: ["main"],
    logging: true // enables or disables logs
});

client.variables({
    variable: "value"
});

// rest of your index.js..
```

## Transfer aoi.db database

You can indeed transfer your database!

```js
const { AoiClient, LoadCommands } = require("aoi.js");
const { Database } = require("aoi.mongo");

const client = new AoiClient({
  token: "DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
  prefix: "DISCORD BOT PREFIX",
  intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "GuildMembers", "MessageContent"],
  events: ["onInteractionCreate", "onMessage"],
  disableAoiDB: true // This is important, ensure it's set to true. You can't use both at once.
});

const database = new Database(client, {
    url: "mongodb+srv://...", // your mongoDB server uri
    tables: ["main"],
    logging: true, // enables or disables logs
    convertOldData: {
      enabled: true,
      dir: "./database"
    },
});

client.variables({
    variable: "value"
});

// rest of your index.js..
```

### MongoDB URI

- How do I get one?

You need to be registered at https://cloud.mongodb.com/, and create a database accordingly, after you did so follow the steps below:

Then paste it in the **URL** field of the database setup, and you're pretty much done!

#### Server Connection Timeout

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is NOT recommended to do as it'll allow anyone to connect to your database. Only do this if your host changes your IP regularly. Otherwise provide the specific IP or a wildcard!

- Make sure you allowed ALL IPS to connect to your mongoDB server.

`Security` -> `Network Access` -> `Allow all IPs`
